# Dropbox Shim

This repository is a shim for [Dropbox.js][], a JavaScript library for interfacing with the Dropbox API.
It provided a built version of the library, with CoffeeScript compiled and files concatenated, as opposed to the source files in the original repo.
When using JavaScript package managers like [Bower][], use this repo instead.

There is also a minified version available, `dropbox.min.js`.

## Get it

    npm install -g bower
    bower install dropbox

[Dropbox.js]: https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js
[Bower]: http://bower.io/
